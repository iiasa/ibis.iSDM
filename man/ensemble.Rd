\title{Function to create an ensemble of multiple fitted models}
\usage{
\S4method{ensemble}{ANY}(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{Provided \code{\link{DistributionModel}} objects}

\item{method}{Approach on how the ensemble is to be created. See details for options (Default: 'mean')}

\item{weights}{(Optional) weights provided to the ensemble function if weighted means are to be constructed. (Default: NULL)}

\item{layername}{A \code{\link{character}} of the layername to be taken from each prediction}
}
\value{
A \code{\link{RasterStack}} containing the ensemble of the provided predictions.
Containing both the set 'method' and a coefficient of variation across predictions.
Critically this should not be interpreted as measure of uncertainty as it cannot
capture parameter uncertainty of individual model; Rather it reflects prediction variation.
}
\description{
This function creates an ensemble of multiple provided distribution models
fitted with the \code{\link{ibis.iSDM-package}}. Each model has to have a predictions with a mean layer and
optional uncertainty in form of the standard deviation or similar.
}
\details{
Possible options for creating an ensemble includes:
'mean' - Calculates the mean of several predictions
'weighted.mean' - Calculates a weighted mean. Weights have to be supplied separately (e.g. TSS)
'min.sd' - Ensemble created by minimizing the uncertainty among predictions
'threshold.frequency' - Returns an ensemble based on threshold frequency (simple count). Requires thresholds to be computed
