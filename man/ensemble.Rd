\title{Function to create an ensemble of multiple fitted models}
\usage{
\S4method{ensemble}{ANY}(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{Provided \code{\link{DistributionModel}} objects}

\item{method}{Approach on how the ensemble is to be created. See details for options (Default: \code{'mean'}).}

\item{weights}{(\emph{Optional}) weights provided to the ensemble function if weighted means are to be constructed (Default: \code{NULL}).}

\item{layer}{A \code{\link{character}} of the layer to be taken from each prediction (Default: \code{'mean'}).}
}
\value{
A \code{\link{RasterStack}} containing the ensemble of the provided predictions specified by \code{method} and a
coefficient of variation across all models.
}
\description{
This function creates an ensemble of multiple provided distribution models
fitted with the \code{\link{ibis.iSDM-package}}. Each model has to have estimated predictions with a given method and
optional uncertainty in form of the standard deviation or similar.

Also returns a coefficient of variation (cv) as output of the ensemble, but note
this should not be interpreted as measure of model uncertainty as it cannot
capture parameter uncertainty of individual model; rather it reflects prediction variation.
}
\details{
Possible options for creating an ensemble includes:
\itemize{
\item \code{'mean'} - Calculates the mean of several predictions
\item \code{'weighted.mean'} - Calculates a weighted mean. Weights have to be supplied separately (e.g. TSS)
\item \code{'min.sd'} - Ensemble created by minimizing the uncertainty among predictions
\item \code{'threshold.frequency'} - Returns an ensemble based on threshold frequency (simple count). Requires thresholds to be computed
}
}
\note{
Take care not to create an ensemble of models constructed with different link functions, e.g. \link{logistic} vs \link{log}
