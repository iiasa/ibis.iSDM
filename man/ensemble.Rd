\title{Function to create an ensemble of multiple fitted models}
\usage{
\S4method{ensemble}{ANY}(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{Provided \code{\link{DistributionModel}} objects.}

\item{method}{Approach on how the ensemble is to be created. See details for options (Default: \code{'mean'}).}

\item{weights}{(\emph{Optional}) weights provided to the ensemble function if weighted means are to be constructed (Default: \code{NULL}).}

\item{min.value}{A \code{\link{numeric}} stating a minimum threshold value that needs to be surpassed in each layer (Default: \code{NULL}).}

\item{layer}{A \code{\link{character}} of the layer to be taken from each prediction (Default: \code{'mean'}).}

\item{normalize}{\code{\link{logical}} on whether the inputs of the ensemble should be normalized to a scale of 0-1 (Default: \code{FALSE}).}
}
\value{
A \code{\link{RasterStack}} containing the ensemble of the provided predictions specified by \code{method} and a
coefficient of variation across all models.
}
\description{
This function creates an ensemble of multiple provided distribution models
fitted with the \code{\link{ibis.iSDM-package}}. Each model has to have estimated predictions with a given method and
optional uncertainty in form of the standard deviation or similar.
Through the \code{layer} parameter it can be specified which part of the prediction
should be averaged in an ensemble. This can be for instance the \emph{mean} prediction and/or
the standard deviation \emph{sd}.

Also returns a coefficient of variation (cv) as output of the ensemble, but note
this should not be interpreted as measure of model uncertainty as it cannot
capture parameter uncertainty of individual models; rather it reflects variation among predictions which
can be due to many factors including simply differences in model complexity.
}
\details{
Possible options for creating an ensemble includes:
\itemize{
\item \code{'mean'} - Calculates the mean of several predictions.
\item \code{'median'} - Calculates the median of several predictions.
\item \code{'weighted.mean'} - Calculates a weighted mean. Weights have to be supplied separately (e.g. TSS).
\item \code{'min.sd'} - Ensemble created by minimizing the uncertainty among predictions.
\item \code{'threshold.frequency'} - Returns an ensemble based on threshold frequency (simple count). Requires thresholds to be computed.
}

In addition to the different ensemble methods, a minimal threshold (\code{min.value}) can be set that needs to be surpassed for averaging.
By default this option is not used (Default: \code{NULL}).

Note by default only the band in the \code{layer} parameter is composited. If supported by the model
other summary statistics from the posterior (e.g. \code{'sd'}) can be specified.
}
\note{
If a list is supplied, then it is assumed that each entry in the list is a fitted \code{\link{DistributionModel}} object.
Take care not to create an ensemble of models constructed with different link functions, e.g. \link{logistic} vs \link{log}.
