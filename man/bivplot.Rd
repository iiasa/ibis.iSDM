\title{Bivariate plot wrapper for distribution objects}
\usage{
bivplot(mod, xvar = "mean", yvar = "sd", plot = TRUE, fname = NULL, ...)

\S4method{bivplot}{ANY}(mod)
}
\arguments{
\item{mod}{A trained \code{DistributionModel} object with \code{fit_best} model within.}

\item{xvar}{A \code{\link{character}} denoting the value on the x-axis (Default: \code{'mean'}).}

\item{yvar}{A \code{\link{character}} denoting the value on the y-axis (Default: \code{'sd'}).}

\item{plot}{A \code{\link{logical}} indication of whether the result is to be plotted?}

\item{fname}{A \code{\link{character}} specifying the output filename a created figure should be written to.}

\item{...}{Other engine specific parameters}
}
\value{
A \link{RasterLayer} with the created partial response.
}
\description{
In particular Bayesian engines can produce not only mean estimates of a fitted response,
but also estimates of uncertainty such as the standard deviation of the posterio or the coefficient
of variation of a given prediction.

This function makes use of the \code{\link{biscale}} R-package to create bivariate plots of the fitted distribution object.
It is mostly thought of as a convenience function to create such plots for quick visualization.
}
\note{
\strong{This function requires the biscale package to be installed.}
Although a work around without the package could be developed, it was not deemed necessary at this point.
