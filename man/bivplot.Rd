\arguments{
\item{mod}{A trained \code{\link{DistributionModel}} or alternatively a \code{\link{SpatRaster}}
object with \code{prediction} model within.}

\item{xvar}{A \code{\link{character}} denoting the value on the x-axis (Default:
\code{'mean'}).}

\item{yvar}{A \code{\link{character}} denoting the value on the y-axis (Default:
\code{'sd'}).}

\item{plot}{A \code{\link{logical}} indication of whether the result is to be plotted
(Default: \code{TRUE})?}

\item{fname}{A \code{\link{character}} specifying the output filename a created figure
should be written to.}

\item{title}{Allows to respecify the title through a \code{\link{character}} (Default:
\code{NULL}).}

\item{col}{A \code{\link{character}} stating the colour palette to use. Has to be
either a predefined value or a vector of colours. See
\code{"biscale::bi_pal_manual"}. Default: \code{"BlueGold"}.}

\item{...}{Other engine specific parameters.}
}
\value{
Saved bivariate plot in \code{'fname'} if specified, otherwise plot.

\description{
Often there is an intention to display not only the predictions
made with a SDM, but also the uncertainty of the prediction. Uncertainty be
estimated either directly by the model or by calculating the variation in
prediction values among a set of models.

In particular Bayesian engines can produce not only mean estimates of fitted
responses, but also pixel-based estimates of uncertainty from the posterior
such as the standard deviation (SD) or the coefficient of variation of a
given prediction.

This function makes use of the \code{"biscale"} R-package to create bivariate
plots of the fitted distribution object, allowing to visualize two variables
at once. It is mostly thought of as a convenience function to create such
bivariate plots for quick visualization.

Supported Inputs are either single trained Bayesian \code{\link{DistributionModel}}
with uncertainty or the output of an \code{\link[=ensemble]{ensemble()}} call. In both cases,
users have to make sure that \code{"xvar"} and \code{"yvar"} are set
accordingly.
}
\note{
\strong{This function requires the biscale package to be installed.}
Although a work around without the package could be developed, it was not
deemed necessary at this point. See also this
