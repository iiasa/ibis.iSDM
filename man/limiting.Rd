\title{Identify local limiting factor}
\usage{
limiting(mod, plot = TRUE)

\S4method{limiting}{ANY}(mod, plot = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{mod}{A fitted \code{'DistributionModel'} object from which limited
factors are to be identified.}

\item{plot}{Should the result be plotted? (Default: \code{TRUE}).}
}
\value{
A \code{terra} object of the most important variable for a given grid cell.
}
\description{
Calculates a \code{\link{SpatRaster}} of locally limiting factors from a
given projected model. To calculate this first the \code{\link{spartial}} effect of
each individual covariate in the model is calculated.

The effect is estimated as that variable most responsible for decreasing
suitability at that cell. The decrease in suitability is calculated, for each
predictor in turn, relative to thesuitability that would be achieved if that
predictor took the value equal to the mean The predictor associated with the
largest decrease in suitability is the most limiting factor.
