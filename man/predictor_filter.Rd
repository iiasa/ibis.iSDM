\title{Filter a set of correlated predictors to fewer ones}
\usage{
predictor_filter(env, keep = NULL, method = "pearson", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{env}{A \code{\link{data.frame}} or \code{\link{matrix}} with extracted environmental
covariates for a given species.}

\item{keep}{A \code{\link{vector}} with variables to keep regardless. These are usually
variables for which prior information is known.}

\item{method}{Which method to use for constructing the correlation matrix
(Options: \code{'pearson'} (Default), \code{'spearman'}| \code{'kendal'}),
\code{"abess"}, or \code{"boruta"}.}

\item{...}{Other options for a specific method}
}
\value{
A \code{\link{character}} \code{\link{vector}} of variable names to be excluded. If the
function fails due to some reason return \code{NULL}.
}
\description{
This function helps to remove highly correlated variables from a
set of predictors. It supports multiple options some of which require both
environmental predictors and observations, others only predictors.

Some of the options require different packages to be pre-installed, such as
\code{ranger} or \code{Boruta}.
}
\details{
Available options are:
\itemize{
\item \code{"none"} No prior variable removal is performed (Default).
\item \code{"pearson"}, \code{"spearman"} or \code{"kendall"} Makes use of pairwise comparisons to identify and
remove highly collinear predictors (Pearson's \code{r >= 0.7}).
\item \code{"abess"} A-priori adaptive best subset selection of covariates via the \code{abess} package (see References). Note that this
effectively fits a separate generalized linear model to reduce the number
of covariates.
\item \code{"boruta"} Uses the \code{Boruta} package to identify non-informative features.
}
}
\note{
Using this function on predictors effectively means that a separate
model is fitted on the data with all the assumptions that come with in
(e.g. linearity, appropriateness of response, normality, etc).
