\title{Adds a boundary constraint to a scenario object}
\usage{
\S4method{add_constraint_boundary}{BiodiversityScenario,sf}(mod, layer, method = "boundary", ...)

\S4method{add_constraint_boundary}{BiodiversityScenario,ANY}(mod, layer, method = "boundary", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{mod}{A \code{\link{BiodiversityScenario}} object with specified predictors.}

\item{layer}{A \code{\link{SpatRaster}} or \code{\link{sf}} object with the same extent as the
model background. Has to be binary and is used for a posthoc masking of
projected grid cells.}

\item{method}{A \code{\link{character}} indicating the type of constraints to be added
to the scenario. See details for more information.}

\item{...}{passed on parameters. See also the specific methods for adding
constraints.}
}
\description{
The purpose of boundary constraints is to limit a future
projection within a specified area (such as for example a range or
ecoregion). This can help to limit unreasonable projections into geographic
space.

Similar to boundary constraints it is also possible to define a \code{"zone"}
for the scenario projections, similar as was done for model training. The
difference to a boundary constraint is that the boundary constraint is
applied posthoc as a hard cut on any projection, while the zones would allow
any projection (and other constraints) to be applied within the zone.
\strong{Note: Setting a boundary constraint for future projections effectively potentially suitable areas!}
