\title{Adds a boundary constraint to a scenario object}
\usage{
\S4method{add_constraint_boundary}{BiodiversityScenario, sf, character}(mod, layer, method)

\S4method{add_constraint_boundary}{BiodiversityScenario, ANY, character}(mod, layer, method)
}
\arguments{
\item{mod}{A \code{\link{BiodiversityScenario}} object with specified predictors.}

\item{layer}{A \code{\link{Raster}} or \code{\link{sf}} object with the same extent as the model background. Has to be binary and
is used for a posthoc masking of projected grid cells.}

\item{method}{A \code{\link{character}} indicating the type of constraints to be added to the scenario. See details for more
information.}

\item{...}{passed on parameters. See also the specific methods for adding constraints.}
}
\description{
The purpose of boundary constraints is to limit a future projection within a specified area
(such as for example a range or ecoregion). This can help to limit unreasonable projections into geographic space.

Similar to boundary constraints it is also possible to define a \code{"zone"} for the scenario projections, similar
as was done for model training. The difference to a boundary constraint is that the boundary constraint is applied posthoc
as a hard cut on any projection, while the zones would allow any projection (and other constraints) to be applied within
the zone.
\strong{Note: Setting a boundary constraint for future projections effectively potentially suitable areas!}
