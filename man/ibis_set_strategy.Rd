ibis_set_strategy(strategy = "sequential")

\description{
Small helper function to respecify the strategy for parallel processing (Default: \code{'sequential'}).
}
\details{
Currently supported strategies are:
\itemize{
\item \code{"sequential"} = Resolves futures sequentially in the current R process (Package default).
\item \code{"multisession"} = Resolves futures asynchronously across \code{'cores'} sessions.
\item \code{"multicore"} = Resolves futures asynchronously across on forked processes. Only works on UNIX systems!
\item \code{"cluster"} = Resolves futures asynchronously in sessions on this or more machines.
\item \code{"slurm"} = To be implemented: Slurm linkage via batchtools.
}
