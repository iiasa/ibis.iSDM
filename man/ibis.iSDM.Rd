\description{
Integrated framework of modelling the distribution of species and ecosystems in
a suitability framing. This package allows the estimation of integrated species
distribution models (iSDM) based on several sources of evidence and provided
presence-only and presence-absence datasets. It makes heavy use of point-process
models for estimating habitat suitability and allows to include spatial latent
effects and priors in the estimation. To do so 'ibis.iSDM' supports a number
of engines for Bayesian and more non-parametric machine learning estimation.
Further, the 'ibis.iSDM' is specifically customized to support spatial-temporal
projections of habitat suitability into the future.
