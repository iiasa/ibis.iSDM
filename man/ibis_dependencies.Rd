\item{deps}{A \code{\link{vector}} with the names of the packages to be installed (Default: \code{"ibis.dependencies"} in \code{\link{ibis_options}}).}

\item{update}{A \code{\link{logical}} flag of whether all (installed) packages should also be checked for updates (Default: \code{TRUE}).}
}
\value{

}
\description{
Some of the dependencies (R-Packages) that ibis.iSDM relies on are by intention
not added to the Description of the file to keep the number of mandatory dependencies small
and enable the package to run even on systems that might not have all libraries pre-installed.

This function provides a convenience wrapper to install those missing dependencies as needed. It
furthermore checks which packages require updating and updates them as needed.
}
\note{
INLA is handled in a special way as it is not available via cran.
