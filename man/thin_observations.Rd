\usage{
thin_observations(
  df,
  background,
  env = NULL,
  method = "random",
  minpoints = 10,
  mindistance = NULL,
  zones = NULL,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A \code{\link{sf}} or \code{\link{data.frame}} object with observed occurrence points.
All methods threat presence-only and presence-absence occurrence points
equally.}

\item{background}{A \code{\link{SpatRaster}} object with the background of the study
region. Use for assessing point density.}

\item{env}{A \code{\link{SpatRaster}} object with environmental covariates. Needed when
method is set to \code{"environmental"} or \code{"bias"} (Default:
\code{NULL}).}

\item{method}{A \code{\link{character}} of the method to be applied (Default:
\code{"random"}).}

\item{minpoints}{A \code{\link{numeric}} giving the number of data points at minimum to
take (Default: \code{10}).}

\item{mindistance}{A \code{\link{numeric}} for the minimum distance of neighbouring
observations (Default: \code{NULL}).}

\item{zones}{A \code{\link{SpatRaster}} to be supplied when option \code{"method"} is
chosen (Default: \code{NULL}).}

\item{verbose}{\code{\link{logical}} of whether to print some statistics about the
thinning outcome (Default: \code{TRUE}).}
}
\description{
For most species distribution modelling approaches it is assumed
that occurrence records are unbiased, which is rarely the case. While
model-based control can alleviate some of the effects of sampling bias, it
can often be desirable to account for some sampling biases through spatial
thinning (Aiello‐Lammens et al. 2015). This is an approach based on the
assumption that oversampled grid cells contribute little more than bias,
rather than strengthing any environmental responses. This function provides
some methods to apply spatial thinning approaches. Note that this
effectively removes data prior to any estimation and its use should be
considered with care (see also Steen et al. 2021).

\details{
Currently implemented thinning methods:
\itemize{
\item \code{"random"}: Samples at random up to number of \code{"minpoints"} across all occupied grid cells.
Does not account for any spatial or environmental distance between
observations.
\item \code{"bias"}: This option removed explicitly points that are considered biased (parameter \code{"env"}) only.
Points are preferentially thinned from grid cells which are in the 25\% most
biased (larger values assumed greater bias) and have high point density.
Thins the observations up to \code{"minpoints"}.
\item \code{"zones"}: Assesses for each observation that it falls with a maximum of \code{"minpoints"} into
each occupied zone. Careful: If the zones are relatively wide this can
remove quite a few observations.
\item \code{"environmental"}: This approach creates an observation-wide clustering (k-means) under the assumption
that the full environmental niche has been comprehensively sampled and is
covered by the provided covariates \code{env}. We then obtain an number
equal to (\code{"minpoints"}) of observations for each cluster.
\item \code{"spatial"}: Calculates the spatial distance between all observations. Then points are removed
iteratively until the minimum distance between points is crossed.  The
\code{"mindistance"} parameter has to be set for this function to work.

 # Thin a certain number of observations
