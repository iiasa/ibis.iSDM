\title{Add latent spatial effect to the model equation}
\usage{
add_latent_spatial(
  x,
  method = "spde",
  priors = NULL,
  separate_spde = FALSE,
  ...
)

\S4method{add_latent_spatial}{BiodiversityDistribution}(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{\code{\link[=distribution]{distribution()}} (i.e. \code{\linkS4class{BiodiversityDistribution}}) object.}

\item{method}{A \code{\link{character}} describing what kind of spatial effect is to be added to the model. See details.}

\item{priors}{A \code{\link{Prior-List}} object supplied to the latent effect. Relevant only for \code{\link{engine_inla}} and \code{NULL} equates the use of default priors.}

\item{separate_spde}{A \code{\link{logical}} parameter indicating whether, in the case of SPDE effects, separate effects
for each likelihood are being fitted. Default (\code{FALSE}) uses a copy of the first added likelihood.}

\item{...}{Other parameters passed down}
}
\description{
Adding latent spatial error terms, spatial trends or other covariates
to a model can account for spatial dependence in response or covariates.
}
\details{
There are several different options which depend on the engine used. In case a
unsupported method for an engine is chosen this is modified to the next similar method
Available are:
\itemize{
\item \code{"spde"} - stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) for \code{\link{INLA-engine}} and \code{\link{INLABRU-engine}}.
SPDE effects aim at capturing the variation of the response variable in space, once all of the covariates are accounted for.
Examining the spatial distribution of the spatial error can reveal which covariates might be missing.
For example, if elevation is positively correlated with the response variable, but is not included in the model,
we could see a higher posterior mean in areas with higher elevation.
\item \code{"car"} - conditional autocorrelative errors (CAR) for \code{\link{INLA-engine}}
\item \code{"poly"} - spatial trend correction by adding coordinates as polynominal transformation. Available for all Engines.
\item \code{"nnd"} - nearest neighbour distance. This function calculates the euclidean distance from each grid cell
to the nearest other grid cell with values. Applied across all datasets in the \code{\linkS4class{BiodiversityDistribution}}) object. .Available for all Engines.
