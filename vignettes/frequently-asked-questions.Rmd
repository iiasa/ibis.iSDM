# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

This document contains a series of frequently asked questions when using the \pkg{ibis.iSDM} package and is a work in progress.

### Model estimation

<b>Is there a way to limit my predictions to only certain regions in the extent?</b>

</summary>

Yes, this can be a desirable outcome during the modelling. For instance one can make - in the absence of better information on dispersal constrain (see *add_constrain_dispersal*) - the assumption that certain species can only disperse within a given ecoregion and not beyond. See for instance the method section of [Wessels, Merow and Trisos (2021)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10113-021-01755-5#Sec2).

To do this with ibis, one has to specify the limit of projection to the *distribution* object.

```{r, echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE}
# Where zone is a provided raster
mod <- distribution(background, limits = zone) %>% 
  add_biodiversity_poipo(species_data) %>% 
  engine_gdb() %>% 
  train()
plot(mod)
```
