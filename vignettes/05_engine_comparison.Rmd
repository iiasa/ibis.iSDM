# Capabilities of included engines

Not every engine included in the \pkg{ibis.iSDM} package supports every functionality.
As outlined by [Fletcher et al. (2019)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ecy.2710), there are many different forms of integration such as through [ensemble] modelling, adding [offsets] or [priors] and through full integration of different likelihoods.
Below a list of each of the different forms of integration can be found and the engines
that support it.

<TBD>
* [`ensemble`]
* [`offset`]
