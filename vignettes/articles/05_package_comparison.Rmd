# Comparison with other packages

Species distribution modelling (SDM) approaches have been around for quite some while and as a result a number of ecological modelling focused packages have been developed. In general most of them are customized towards specific purposes and modelling paradigm.
So isnâ€™t this just another SDM package? 
Indeed it is, but `ibis.iSDM` has a number of particular features that set it apart from most other SDM packages: 
  
  1. It focuses particularly on integration as a guiding principle and different ways of how heterogeneous sources
  of evidence can be integrated.
  2. It puts a strong focus on biodiversity types, in particular Poisson-Process models (PPMs) as the default way of analyzing presence-only data.
  3. It follows an object-based and modular programming philosophy, taking inspiration from `tidy` programming approaches.
  4. It supports a number of Bayesian SDM approaches and algorithms, a field traditionally less represented owing to computational constraints.
  5. It is customized to create and modify spatio-temporal scenarios, including IIASA integrated land-use assessment model [GLOBIOM](https://iiasa.github.io/GLOBIOM/index.html).
  
Thus overall, the idea package is in part trying to bring some innovation to the SDM modelling world, while also trying to bring together strengths from different existing tools.

A Non exhaustive list acknowledging other SDM packages in R and how they compare to `ibis.iSDM` is provided here:

-   [hSDM](https://github.com/ghislainv/hSDM) -&gt; Bayesian framework for hierachical and mixed models. Fast, but little flexibility with regards to weights, offsets and different datatypes.
-   [multispeciesPP](https://github.com/wfithian/multispeciesPP) -&gt;
    Package that allows integrated SDMs, however it has not been further developed since a few years and key gaps remain particular with regards to different modelling approaches.
-   [inlabru](https://github.com/inlabru-org/inlabru) -&gt; Package
    specifically for Lox-Gaussian-Cox Process (LGCP) models with INLA, now integrated also as engine in _ibis.iSDM_
-   [pointedSDMs](https://github.com/oharar/PointedSDMs) -&gt; Another wrapper for INLA
    that allows to integrate different datasets in a SDM. Less focus on priors, offsets and scenarios.
-   [biomod2](https://github.com/biomodhub/biomod2) -&gt; Popular
    package for ensemble modelling, but fixed on specific (non-Bayesian) engines and data types and 
    with no integration options.
-   [sdmTMB](https://github.com/pbs-assess/sdmTMB) -&gt; Package for
    fitting spatial-Temporal SDMs for very specific biodiversity data.
-   [modleR](https://github.com/Model-R/modleR) -&gt; similar as biomod2
    and a wrapper to construct ensembles of models. 
-   [kuenm](https://peerj.com/articles/6281/) -&gt; Another wrapper for
    Maxent.
-   [flexSDM](https://sjevelazco.github.io/flexsdm/) Similar as biomod2 a wrapper
    for SDMs, but coming with several helper functions for data preparation and cross-validation.

Besides SDMs there are also new packages available on spatial and integrated species occupancy models, such as 
[spOccupancy](https://www.jeffdoser.com/files/spoccupancy-web/). Occupancy modelling however requires some
very specific biodiversity data and information to infer detectability of species occurrences.
