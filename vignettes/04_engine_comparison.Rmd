# Capabilities of included engines

As outlined by [Fletcher et al. (2019)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ecy.2710), there are many different forms of integration such as through [`ensemble`] modelling, adding [`offsets`] or [`priors`] and through full integration of different likelihoods (See ([2](02_integrate_data.html)) ). Not all of these options are available for every engine supported by the *ibis.iSDM* package and the table below shows the currently implemented engines and various types of integrations supported by them.

Stating the name and function call of each engine and its supported model complexity with linear (ln) and non-linear (nl) formulations, although it should be noted that linear models can approximate non-linearity by including transformations (as with Maxent, e.g. hinge/product/quadratic). Not every engine supports the different types of integration via `ensembles`, `offsets`, `priors`, joint likelihood estimation and `ensemble` compositing of models using separate datasets of the same species.
