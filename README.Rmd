The ibis.iSDM package provides a series of convenience functions to fit integrated Species Distribution Models (iSDMs). With integrated models we generally refer to SDMs that incorporate information from different biodiversity datasets, external parameters such as priors or offsets with respect to certain variables and regions. See [Fletcher et al. (2019)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ecy.2710) and [Isaac et al. (2020)](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0169534719302551) for an introduction.

Isn't this just another SDM package? Indeed it is, but building our own modelling infrastructure allows greater flexibility in how models are created and run. It is less about reinventing the wheel, but rather bringing strengths from different tools together. 
*Not exhaustive list acknowledging other SDM packages in R:*

* [hSDM](https://github.com/ghislainv/hSDM) -> Bayesian framework for mixed models. Fast, but little flexibility with regards to weights or offsets
* [multispeciesPP](https://github.com/wfithian/multispeciesPP) -> Not been further developed since years
* [inlabru](https://github.com/inlabru-org/inlabru) -> Package specifically for LGCP with INLA, however little support to other engines, likelihoods or data
* [pointedSDMs](https://github.com/oharar/PointedSDMs) -> INLA based SDM package for integrating different datasets. 
* [biomod2](https://github.com/biomodhub/biomod2) -> Popular package for ensemble modeling, but no integration, not Bayesian
* [sdmTMB](https://github.com/pbs-assess/sdmTMB) -> Package for fitting spatial-Temporal SDMs
* [modleR](https://github.com/Model-R/modleR) -> similar as biomod2 a wrapper to construct ensembles of models
* [kuenm](https://peerj.com/articles/6281/) -> Another wrapper for Maxent

## Installation

Currently only as development version on GitHub. 

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE, message=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("IIASA/ibis")
```

## Features and next key milestones

* âœ… Fitting Point Poisson Models (PPMs) using INLA and at least another Engine
* âœ… Basic documentation present that however can be further improved
* âœ… Various functions to include offsets, ranges, predictor transformations
* âœ… Plotting functions for models and effect are there
* ðŸš§ Actually support multiple likelihoods depending on included biodiversity dataset
* ðŸš§ Add a wrapper for PPMs in Stan as new engine for max flexibility
* ðŸš§ Implement options to add occupancy model for detectability, see [Altwegg and Nichols](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/2041-210X.13090) and [Guillera-Arroita](http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/ecog.02445)
* ðŸš§ Add new class for priors and ensure that they linked in a flexible manner
* ðŸš§ There are reports that iCAR can [outperforms](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1204.6087v1.pdf) Matern covariance? It likely is also considerably faster, thus could be implemented
* ðŸš§ Create a pkgdown website for the package with tutorials (see below)
* ...

## Development guidelines

- The ibis.iSDM contains primarily functions for fitting models.
- Speed and flexibility are key
- Don't repeat yourself. Create new functions and if necessary classes. Equally try to reuse common names from R, e.g. *plot*, *summary*
- Avoid using additional package dependencies where possible
- Comment your code!! 
- Use assertions to verify inputs to functions
- If bored, please write unit tests and ensure they all evaluate (CRTL+SHIFT+T)!

*Note that pushing to master or forking is disabled at the moment. Pull requests require a confirmation.*

## Usage

Note that the package in constant development and individual functions might change. As soon as the package has reached a stable state, the repository will be made public An official release will be made as soon as the package is public
**In development !!!**
