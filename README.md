The ibis.iSDM package provides a series of convenience functions to fit
integrated Species Distribution Models (iSDMs). With integrated models
we generally refer to SDMs that incorporate information from different
biodiversity datasets, external parameters such as priors or offsets
with respect to certain variables and regions. See [Fletcher et
al. (2019)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ecy.2710)
and [Isaac et
al. (2020)](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0169534719302551)
for an introduction to iSDMs.

## Installation

Currently only as development version on GitHub.

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("IIASA/ibis.iSDM")
```

## Usage

See relevant reference articles and vignettes.

**In development !!!**
Note that the package in constant development and individual functions
might change. As soon as the package has reached a stable state, the
repository will be made public An official release will be made as soon
as the package is public and a preprint has been written.
